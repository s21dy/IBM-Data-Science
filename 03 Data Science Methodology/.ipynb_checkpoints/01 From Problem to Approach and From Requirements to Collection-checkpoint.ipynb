    "\n",
    "### 10 Basic Questions:\n",
    "- What is the problem you're trying to solve?\n",
    "- How can you use data to answer the question?\n",
    "- What data do you need to answer the question?\n",
    "- Where is the data source from, and how will you receive the data?\n",
    "- Does the data you collect represent the problem to be solved?\n",
    "- What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?\n",
    "- When you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem?\n",
    "- Does the data model answer the initial business question, or must you adjust the data?\n",
    "- Can you put the model into practice?\n",
