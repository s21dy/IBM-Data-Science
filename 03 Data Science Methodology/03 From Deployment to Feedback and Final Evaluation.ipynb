    "- Feedback Stage Plan:\n",
    "1. Review Process:\n",

    "    - Track congestive heart failure patients receiving intervention.\n",
    "    - Record their re-admission outcomes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Measure Effectiveness:\n",
    "- Measure the intervention's effectiveness in reducing re-admissions.\n",
    "- Ethical approach: Compare readmission rates before and after model implementation, rather than using controlled and treatment groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refinement and Impact Assessment\n",
    "- First Year Review:\n",
    "    - After one year of implementation, review the impact on re-admission rates.\n",
    "    - Refine the model based on compiled data and knowledge gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Further Refinements:\n",
    "    - Incorporate additional information, such as participation in the intervention program and detailed pharmaceutical data.\n",
    "    - Address the possibility of adding pharmaceutical data if deemed valuable after feedback.\n",
    "    - Allow for other refinements that may arise during the feedback stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review and Refine Actions\n",
    "    - Review and refine intervention actions and processes based on deployment and feedback experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redeployment\n",
    "- Continuous Feedback:\n",
    "    - Redeploy the refined model and intervention actions.\n",
    "    - Continue the feedback process throughout the life of the intervention program."
