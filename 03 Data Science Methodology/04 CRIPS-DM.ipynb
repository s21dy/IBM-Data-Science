    "# Introduction to CRISP-DM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- Objective: Define CRISP-DM, list and describe its six stages, and explain post-final stage actions.\n",
    "- CRISP-DM: Stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.\n",
    "- Purpose: An industry-proven, iterative, and comprehensive methodology for data mining projects providing a structured approach to data-driven decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Six Stages of CRISP-DM\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Understanding:\n",
    "    - Most important stage.\n",
    "    - Sets and outlines the intentions of the data analysis project.\n",
    "    - Requires communication and clarity to overcome stakeholders' differing objectives and biases.\n",
    "    - Ensures a clear, concise, and complete understanding of the business problem and project goals to avoid wasting time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Understanding:\n",
    "    - Combines data requirements, data collection, and data understanding.\n",
    "    - Data scientists decide on data sources and acquire data.\n",
    "    - Ensures the collection of necessary data for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preparation:\n",
    "    - Transforms collected data into a usable subset.\n",
    "    - Addresses questionable, missing, or ambiguous data values.\n",
    "    - Common to foundational data methodology in CRISP-DM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modeling:\n",
    "    - Creates data models to reveal patterns and structures within the data.\n",
    "    - Provides knowledge and insights addressing the business problem and goals.\n",
    "    - Involves selecting models based on data subsets and adjusting them as needed.\n",
    "    - Model selection is both an art and a science.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Tests the selected model with a pre-selected test.\n",
    "    - Assesses the model's effectiveness and determines its efficacy.\n",
    "    - Results foreshadow the model's role in the deployment stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deployment:\n",
    "    - Uses the model on new data outside of the initial dataset.\n",
    "    - New interactions may reveal new variables and the need for different datasets and models.\n",
    "    - The iterative and cyclical nature of CRISP-DM may initiate revisions to business needs, the model, and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Final Stage Actions\n",
    "- Business Understanding Meeting: After all six stages, hold another meeting with stakeholders to discuss results.\n",
    "- Feedback Stage: Though not named in CRISP-DM, it corresponds to the Feedback stage in John Rollins' methodology.\n",
    "- Iteration: Continue the CRISP-DM process until stakeholders, management, and data scientists agree that the data model and its analysis provide the necessary answers to resolve business problems and attain goals.\n"
