    "# Introduction to R and RStudio\n",
    "- R is a statistical programming language used for data processing, statistical inference, data analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "- R is widely used in academia, healthcare, and government.\n",
    "- R supports importing data from various sources and is known for producing great visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## RStudio Environment\n",
    "- RStudio is an integrated development environment for developing and running R language source code and programs.\n",
    "- RStudio includes:\n",
    "    - Syntax-highlighting editor for direct code execution\n",
    "    - Console for typing R commands\n",
    "    - Workspace and History tab for tracking R objects and commands\n",
    "    - Files, Plots, Packages, and Help tabs for managing files, plots, packages, and help resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## R Libraries for Data Science\n",
    "- Popular R libraries for data science include:\n",
    "    - dplyr for data manipulation\n",
    "    - stringr for string manipulation\n",
    "    - ggplot for data visualization\n",
    "    - caret for machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization in R\n",
    "\n",
    "- R offers various data visualization packages: ggplot (most popular), plotly (web-based), lattice (complex data), leaflet (interactive maps). You can install them using install.packages(\"package_name\").\n",
    "- R also has built-in plotting functions: You can create basic scatterplots and customize them with lines and titles.\n",
    "- ggplot library provides powerful visualizations: It allows adding layers (like points) and arguments (like axis labels) to create informative graphs. You can use functions like geom_point for scatterplots.\n",
    "- GGally library extends ggplot: It simplifies creating complex visualizations by combining geometric objects with transformed data."

    "# Git and GitHub\n",
    "- Git and GitHub are popular tools for version control and collaboration among developers and data scientists.\n",
    "- Version control allows tracking changes to files, recovering older versions, and easier collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git?\n",
    "- Git is free and open-source distributed version control software.\n",
    "- Distributed means users can have a copy of the project locally and sync changes to a remote server.\n",
    "- Git is widely used for code but can also version control other file types like images and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Git Terms\n",
    "- SSH: Secure remote login protocol\n",
    "- Repository: Project folders set up for version control\n",
    "- Fork: Copy of a repository\n",
    "- Pull Request: Request to review and approve changes\n",
    "- Working Directory: Files associated with a Git repository on your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Git Commands\n",
    "- git init: Create a new repository\n",
    "- git add: Move changes from working directory to staging area\n",
    "- git status: See state of working directory and staged changes\n",
    "- git commit: Commit staged changes to the project\n",
    "- git reset: Undo changes in the working directory\n",
    "- git log: Browse previous changes\n",
    "- git branch: Create an isolated environment for changes\n",
    "- git checkout: Switch between branches\n",
    "- git merge: Merge branches together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Git\n",
    "- GitHub has resources like cheat sheets and tutorials at [try.github.io](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git) to learn essential Git commands.\n",
    "- The course will provide a crash course on setting up local environment and getting started with a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Source Repositories and GitHub\n",
    "- Source repositories are used to manage and track changes to source code during software development.\n",
    "- **GitHub** is an online hosting service that satisfies the needs of a source repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History of Git\n",
    "- Git was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to replace BitKeeper for Linux development.\n",
    "- Key characteristics of Git include support for **non-linear development**, **distributed development**, **compatibility with existing systems**, **efficient handling of large projects**, **cryptographic authentication**, and **pluggable merge strategies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Repository Model\n",
    "- Git is a distributed version control system primarily focused on **tracking source code changes**.\n",
    "- It allows coordination among programmers, tracking changes, and supporting non-linear workflows.\n",
    "- Each developer has a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied between repositories.\n",
    "- There is typically a main branch for deployable code, and separate branches for ongoing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "- GitHub is an **online hosting service for Git repositories**, owned by Microsoft.\n",
    "- It offers free, professional, and enterprise accounts, with over 100 million repositories as of 2019.\n",
    "- Repositories store documents like source code and enable version control and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitLab\n",
    "- GitLab is a complete DevOps platform that provides access to Git repositories and source code management.\n",
    "- It allows developers to collaborate, review code, work from local copies, branch and merge code, and streamline testing and delivery with built-in CI/CD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git Hub Repository\n",
    "### Repository Tabs\n",
    "- Code: Contains all source files\n",
    "- Issues: Track and plan issues/items against the project\n",
    "- Pull Requests: Mechanism for collaborating, reviewing changes before merging\n",
    "Projects: Tools for project management and planning\n",
