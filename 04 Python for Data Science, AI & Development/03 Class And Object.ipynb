    "## Introduction to classes and object\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that uses a paradigm centered around objects and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that its objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a cookie cutter and objects as the cookies cut from that template.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create classes using the ```class``` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating classes\n",
    "When you create a class, you specify the ```attributes```(data) and ```methods``` (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "```Attributes``` are defined as variables within the class, and ```methods ``` are defined as functions.\n",
    "For example,you can design a \"Car\" class with attributes such as \"color\" and \"speed,\" along with methods like \"accelerate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "An ***object*** is a fundamental unit in Python that represents a real-world entity or concept.\n",
    "Objects can be tangible (like a car) or abstract (like a student's grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has two main characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State\n",
    "    The attributes or data that describe the object. For your \"Car\" object, this might include attributes like \"color\", \"speed\", and \"fuel level\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Behavior\n",
    "    The actions or methods that the object can perform. In Python, methods are functions that belong to objects and can change the object's state or perform specific operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiating objects\n",
    "Once you've defined a ***class***, you can create ***individual objects (instances)**** based on that class.\n",
    "Each object is independent and has its own set of attributes and methods.\n",
    "To create an object, you use the class name followed by parentheses, so: \"my_car = Car()\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interacting with objects\n",
    "You interact with objects by calling their methods or accessing their attributes using dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a ***Car object*** named my_car, you can set its color with ```my_car.color = \"blue\"``` and accelerate it with ```my_car.accelerate()``` if there's an accelerate method defined in the class.\n",
    "\n"
