    "# Jupyter Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- A kernel is a computational engine that executes code in a Notebook file.\n",
    "- Jupyter Kernels exist for many languages, including Python, Apache, Julia, R, and Swift.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Kernels\n",
    "- When a Notebook opens, the related kernel launches automatically.\n",
    "- The kernel performs computations and produces results.\n",
    "- Users can switch between kernels by selecting the language on the launch page or clicking the top right icon and selecting from the drop-down menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Kernels\n",
    "- In the Skills Network lab environment, some languages are pre-installed.\n",
    "- On a local machine, users need to manually install languages through the command line interface (CLI).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jupyter Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- Jupyter architecture implements a two-process model with a kernel and a client.\n",
    "- The client is the interface offering the user the ability to send code to the kernel.\n",
    "- The kernel executes the code and returns the result to the client for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "- Client: The browser in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- Kernel: Executes the code and returns the result to the client.\n",
    "- Notebook Server: Responsible for saving and loading notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Conversion\n",
    "- Jupyter architecture uses the NB convert tool to convert files to other formats.\n",
    "- The process involves:\n",
    "    - Preprocessor: Modifies the notebook file.\n",
    "    - Exporter: Converts the notebook to the new file format.\n",
    "    - Postprocessor: Works on the exported file to give the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example\n",
    "        1. Converting a notebook file to an HTML file:\n",
    "        2. The notebook is modified by a preprocessor.\n",
    "        3. An exporter converts the notebook to HTML.\n",
    "        4. A postprocessor works on the exported file to give the final output.\n",
    "        5. The HTML file is displayed when the URL is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Additional Anaconda Jupyter Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "- Anaconda is a free and open-source distributor for Python and R, the top languages used in data science and machine learning.\n",
    "- Anaconda has over 1500 libraries and provides free community support for users.\n",
    "- The Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface allows users to install new packages on their local device without using a command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JupyterLab\n",
    "- JupyterLab is an open-source, web-based application based on Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- It includes expanded features with some of Anaconda's most extensive pre-installed Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- To launch JupyterLab, click \"Launch\" in the JupyterLab box in the Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- To start with the Jupyter Notebook, type \"Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3)\" in the search bar of the Anaconda Navigator and press enter.\n",
    "- The JupyterLab dashboard opens in the browser on the localhost and is specifically designed to manage Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- To create a new Jupyter Notebook, click \"New\" and select \"Python 3\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## VS Code\n",
    "- VS Code is a free, open-source code editor that supports multiple languages, syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and more.\n",
    "- To open VS Code using Anaconda Navigator, open Anaconda Navigator, find the VS Code application, and click \"Launch\".\n",
    "- To execute Python code in VS Code, install the necessary extensions, create a new Jupyter Notebook file, write your code, and execute it using the \"RUN\" icon.\n"

    "## Additional Cloud-Based Jupyter Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "- Cloud-based Jupyter environments are used to create and modify Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.\n",
    "- Popular cloud-based environments include JupyterLite and Google Colaboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLite\n",
    "- JupyterLite is a lightweight tool built from JupyterLab components that executes entirely in the browser.\n",
    "- It does not require a dedicated Jupyter server, only a web server.\n",
    "- JupyterLite supports many visualization libraries like Altair, Plotly, and ipywidgets.\n",
    "- To launch JupyterLite, open a browser and type jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab in the URL field.\n",
    "- JupyterLite includes the latest improvements and features from JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Colaboratory\n",
    "- Google Colaboratory (or 'GoogleColab') is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud.\n",
    "- GoogleColab Jupyter notebooks execute on a browser, and GoogleColab projects are stored on Google Drive and GitHub.\n",
    "- You can upload and share notebooks without setup and installation.\n",
    "- You can also clone projects from GitHub and execute them in GoogleColab.\n",
    "- Most machine learning and visualization libraries are pre-installed, like scikit-learn and matplotlib.\n",
