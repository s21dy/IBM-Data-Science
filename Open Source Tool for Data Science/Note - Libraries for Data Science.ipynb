    "### Overview\n",
    "- An API (Application Programming Interface) allows communication between two pieces of software.\n",
    "- It is the part of the library that is visible to the user, while the library contains all the program components.\n",
    "    - Example: Pandas Library\n",
    "    - Pandas is a set of software components that can be used to process data.\n",
    "    - The Pandas API allows communication with the other software components without knowing what happens at the backend.\n",
    "    - The backend can be written in different languages, such as C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST API\n",
    "- REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs allow communication through the internet and access to resources like storage, data, and artificially intelligent algorithms.\n",
    "- The client (your program) sends requests to the resource (web service) via an endpoint.\n",
    "- The client sends requests using HTTP methods, and the resource returns a response using HTTP messages.\n",
    "- The request contains a JSON file with instructions for the operation to be performed.\n",
    "- The response contains the result of the operation in a JSON file.\n",
    "    - Examples of REST APIs\n",
    "    - Watson Text to Speech API: Converts speech to text.\n",
    "    - Watson Language-Translator API: Translates text from one language to another.\n"

    "### Definition of a Data Set\n",
    "- A data set is a structured collection of data.\n",
    "- It can include various types of data such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video files.\n",
    "- Tabular data sets are organized in rows and columns, with each row representing an observation and each column containing information about that observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Ownership\n",
    "- Private Data: Typically contains proprietary or confidential information and is not shared publicly.\n",
    "- Open Data: Made available to the public, often by governments, organizations, or companies, and can be used for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources of Data\n",
    "- Government Data: Many governments worldwide publish datasets on their websites, covering various topics such as economy, society, healthcare, transportation, and more.\n",
    "- Intergovernmental Organizations: Organizations like the United Nations and the European Union maintain data repositories providing access to a wide range of information.\n",
    "- Online Communities: Platforms like Kaggle provide access to a variety of datasets, and users can contribute their own datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Community Data License Agreement (CDLA)\n",
    "- Created by the Linux Foundation to address the issue of open data distribution and use.\n",
    "- Two licenses were initially created: CDLA-Sharing and CDLA-Permissive.\n",
    "- CDLA-Sharing: Grants permission to use and modify the data, with the requirement to share modified versions under the same license terms.\n",
    "- CDLA-Permissive: Grants permission to use and modify the data, but does not require sharing changes to the data.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **PUBLIC DOMAIN MARK - PUBLIC DOMAIN:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When a dataset has a Public Domain license, all the rights to use, access, modify and share the dataset are open to everyone. Here there is technically no license.\n",
