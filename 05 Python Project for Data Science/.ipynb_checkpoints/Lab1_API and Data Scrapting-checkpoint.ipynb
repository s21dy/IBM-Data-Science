    "# Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called \"shares.\" [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "An investor can buy a stock and sell it later. If the stock price increases, the investor profits, If it decreases,the investor with incur a loss.  Determining the stock price is complex; it depends on the number of outstanding shares, the size of the company's future profits, and much more. People trade stocks throughout the day the stock ticker is a report of the price of a certain stock, updated continuously throughout the trading session by the various stock market exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to determine any suspicious stock activity by extracting stock data using a Python library. This project use the yfinance library, allows us to extract data for stocks returning data in a pandas dataframe. You will use the lab to extract."
